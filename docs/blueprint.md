## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) to provide a neutral and clean backdrop, ensuring data is the primary focus. A lighter white (#FFFFFF) will be used for sidebars, headers, and the pop-up wizard.
- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to maintain a professional and calming appearance that reflects a trustworthy tool. This is desaturated compared to the suggested color.
- Accent color: Light blue (#7986CB) to subtly emphasize important UI elements. It differs slightly in both brightness and saturation from the primary to add contrast, ensuring key actions are clearly highlighted without overwhelming the design.
- Font Family: Consistent use of a clean, modern sans-serif font like Roboto, Open Sans, or Helvetica Neue to ensure optimal readability across the application.
- Style: Use simple, outline icons consistently across the app for a clean and modern look. These icons should primarily be in dark grey, changing to the Accent Blue (#7986CB) on hover or when selected to provide clear feedback to the user.
- Strategic use of spacing and padding to provide a visually organized and comfortable user experience. Employ generous internal padding within elements, consistent margins between components, and a well-structured layout to prevent clutter.
- Subtle hover effects and transitions to create a smooth, responsive user interface. Animations should be minimal, such as a slight color change or a gentle underline, to indicate interactivity without being distracting.
